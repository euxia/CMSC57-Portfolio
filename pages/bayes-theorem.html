            <h1>Bayes's Theorem</h1>

            <p class="justify-text">
                As we enter week 13 of our exploration into Discrete Mathematical Structures, we encounter Bayes' theorem, a concept that has proven to be particularly challenging for me. Despite dedicating time and effort to understand it, I continue to struggle, often receiving failing marks on quizzes as a result. This frustration has tested my resolve, but I remain determined to overcome this obstacle. Though the journey may be difficult, I am committed to persevering, seeking assistance from peers and investing extra effort into studying the material. While Bayes' theorem presents a significant challenge, I eventually wrapped my head around it but not in all of its entirety.

            <p class="justify-text">
                Bayes' theorem provides a framework for updating the probability of an event based on new evidence or information. It states that if we have two events, E and F, from a sample space S, and both events have non-zero probabilities (p(E) ≠ 0 and p(F) ≠ 0), then we can determine the probability of event E occurring given that event F has occurred.
            </p>

            <p class="justify-text">
                The theorem is particularly useful in situations where we have prior knowledge or beliefs about the likelihood of certain events, and we want to update these probabilities in light of new evidence or observations. It is widely applied in fields such as statistics, machine learning, and Bayesian inference to make predictions, classify data, and infer relationships between variables. 
            </p>

            <p class="justify-text">
                There are many applications of baye's theorem in real life. One of the most common applications is in medical diagnosis. For example, a doctor may use Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that a patient has a particular disease given their symptoms and test results. By combining the patient's symptoms with the test's accuracy and the prevalence of the disease in the population, the doctor can make a more informed diagnosis.

            <p class="justify-text">
                A real-life example of Bayes' theorem in action is in medical diagnosis, particularly in the context of disease testing. Consider a scenario where a person undergoes a medical test for a particular disease, such as COVID-19.
            </p>

            <p class="justify-text">
                Let's define: Event E: the person has the disease, Event F: the person tests positive for the disease.
            </p>

            <p class="justify-text">
                Using Bayes' theorem allows us to refine our understanding of the likelihood of someone having a disease given that they tested positive (P(E|F)).
            </p>
            <p class="justify-text">
                For instance:
            </p>
            <p class="justify-text">
                We first estimate the likelihood of having the disease beforehand, which could be influenced by factors like the disease's prevalence or symptoms (P(E)).
            </p>
            <p class="justify-text">
                Next, we assess the probability of testing positive if the person truly has the disease, often termed as the test's sensitivity (P(F|E)).
            </p>
            <p class="justify-text">
                We also consider the overall probability of testing positive, incorporating factors like false positive rates (P(F)).
            </p>
            
            <p class="justify-text">
                By incorporating these values into Bayes' theorem, we can calculate P(E|F), indicating the probability of the person actually having the disease after testing positive. This aids in making informed decisions regarding further medical actions, treatment strategies, and patient care.
