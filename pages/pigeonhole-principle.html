            <p class="justify-text">Basics of Counting technically is a prerequisite in understanding the principles of combinatorics. There are fundamental rules to be remembered for Basics of Counting. Product Rule and Sum Rule. Product rule theory states that; suppose a procedure can be broken down into a sequence of two tasks. There are n1 ways to do the first task and n2 ways to do the second task. Then there are n1âˆ™n2 ways to do the procedure.</p>

            <p class="justify-text"><strong>Product Rule Example: </strong> Suppose I have a store with hats featuring two designs: one with stars and one with stripes. For the star hats, I have 2 styles and each style comes in 2 colors. For the stripe hats, I have 2 styles and each style comes in 3 colors. I want to buy a star hat and a stripe hat. </p>

            <img src="../img-pages/basics-of-counting-product.png" class="card-img-week mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">

            <p class="justify-text">First, calculate the total number of star hats: <strong>2 (styles) x 2 (colors) = 4 (star hats) </strong> </p>
            <p class="justify-text">Next, calculate the total number of stripe hats: <strong>2 (styles) x 3 (colors) = 6 (stripe hats) </strong></p>
            <p class="justify-text">Next, calculate the total number of stripe hats: <strong>4 (star hats) x 6 (stripe hats) = 24 (total hat options) </strong></p>

            <p class="justify-text"> Sum rule, on the other hand, states that; If a task can be done either in one of n1 ways or in one of n2 ways to do the second task, where none of the set of n1 ways is the same as any of the n2 ways, then there are n1 + n2 ways to do the task.</p>

            <p class="justify-text"><strong>Sum Rule Example: </strong> If there are 5 ways to get to school by bus and 3 ways by bike, and I can choose only one mode of transportation, then there are 5 + 3 = 8 ways to get to school.
            </p>
            
            <p class="justify-text">These fundamental concepts must be understood because it is the foundation of many topics to come. By combining the two concepts, sum rule and product rule, we can solve real life problems that already involved combinatorics. </p>

            <p class="fst-italic fs-6">"How many bit strings of length eight either start with a bit or end with the two bits?"</p>

            <p class="justify-text">The number of bit strings of length eight that start with a 1 bit is 2<sup>7</sup> = 128. The number of bit strings of length eight that start with the bits 00 is 2<sup>6</sup> = 64. The number of bit strings of length eight that start with a 1 bit and end with the bits 00 is 2<sup>5</sup> = 32. Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, the total number of bit strings of length eight that start with a 1 bit or start with 00 is 128 + 64 - 32 = 160.</p>
